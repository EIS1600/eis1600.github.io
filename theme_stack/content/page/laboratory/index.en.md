- description: The OpenITI NgramReader is a tool similar to Google Ngram Viewer, which is designed to trace the use of words and phrases over time. OpenITI NgramReader is a general tool that can be of value to anyone who wants to trace the usage of specific unigrams, bigrams, or trigrams over time. Just to give a general idea of how it works, the graph below shows the use of the verb tasalṭana (to become a sultan) over time, showing that it essentially came into use during the Mamlūk period. Unlike Google Ngram Viewer, the OpenITI NgramReader also gives a detailed report on what authors (and in which books) use words and phrases in question. For example, the verb tasalṭana is not overly frequent—used some 2,400 times across our corpus—and roughly a third of its usage is attested in the works of the Mamlūk historian and biographer Ibn Taġribirdī (d. 874/1470), who used tasalṭana almost four times more frequently than the next author on the list of those who favored this verb.
